But it also held a map for how to escape.\\n\\nHer body, she learned, harbored a gene mutation, a single wrong letter of DNA in her \\u201cprion\\u201d gene, that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia. Her mother had died of it the year before, and the test had revealed Vallabh had inherited the flaw too.\\n\\nBy now, the decision by Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, to try to prevent her disease\\u2014\\u201ca prion love story,\\u201d the New Yorker called it\\u2014is well-known. After the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb, they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it. They expect to get PhDs next spring (see \\u201cSonia Vallabh, 35 Innovators Under 35, 2016\\u201d.)\\n\\nNow, after seven years, they think they have found a treatment that can do it. It\\u2019s called an antisense drug, a type of mirror-image molecule that, if it reaches the brain, could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein. That could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases.\\n\\nLess of the protein, Vallabh reasons, and less chance she\\u2019ll get sick.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, on their blog, Vallabh announced she and Minikel were working with a commercial partner, the California biotech company Ionis, which specializes in antisense compounds. \\u201cFor the first time, I am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy,\\u201d she wrote. It\\u2019s \\u201cplausible\\u201d that antisense could treat the disease \\u201cin our lifetime.\\u201d\\n\\nVallabh\\u2019s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age. Given a perfect DNA blueprint of your inherited disease, what\\u2019s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime, or that of someone you love?\\n\\nThere are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark. That is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws, but also because a set of promising technologies\\u2014antisense, gene therapy, and CRISPR gene editing\\u2014are able to replace genes or silence them, in effect fixing genetic problems at their source.\\n\\nA close-up of up brain tissue affected by prions, misfolded protein that are toxic to neurons. wikimedia commons\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s more, these treatments employ the genetic code; they are actually made of DNA or RNA. That means that they\\u2019re fundamentally modular and programmable. At least on paper, it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote.\\n\\nIn reality, drug development is notoriously complicated. Most drugs fail, torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body. But Vallabh says in the early, confusing days of her quest, she received critical advice from Eric Lander, the biologist who leads the Broad Institute, where she and Minikel now study and work. He told her to focus on the genetic error itself\\u2014the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis.\\n\\n\\u201cYou need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking,\\u201d she recalls him saying.\\n\\nThat meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns, like what the prion protein does in the body, or why, when it misfolds, it kills brain cells. \\u201cThere are so many interesting questions about prion disease,\\u201d says Vallabh, who is 34. \\u201cAnd those questions will still be there when we are treating it.\\u201d\\n\\nPrion diseases are profoundly strange because they\\u2019re caused not by a virus, but by an infectious protein. They include scrapie in sheep, Kuru (spread by cannibalism), Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and the human version of mad cow disease.\\n\\nThe key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick, even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains. \\u201cThe biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation, and that can template further copies. It\\u2019s self-templating. That allows it to spread,\\u201d says Kurt Giles, a researcher in the lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where prions were first discovered. \\u201cThat leads to the idea of reducing the [protein]. The less of it there is, then you will get less templating.\\u201d\\n\\nFor genetic therapies, though, there\\u2019s a further problem, which is how to get them into the body so that they reach, for instance, billions of brain cells.\\n\\nAntisense technology, conceived decades ago, had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by Ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy.\\n\\nBy then, Vallabh and Minikel had been introduced to Ionis, and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice. Holly Kordasiewicz, the head of neuroscience at Ionis, recalls the 2014 meeting. \\u201cWe left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nThe company gave Vallabh and Minikel a to-do list, which they quickly worked through. Patient registry? Check. Animal studies? Check. Biomarker to show if a drug is working? That research, too, is under way at a Boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid.\\n\\n\\u201cSonia and Eric are doing this with no real funding, just trying to make it happen,\\u201d says Jeff Carroll, another patient scientist (he\\u2019s got the mutation for Huntington\\u2019s disease), who introduced them to Ionis.\\n\\nOne problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare, quickly fatal, and rarely diagnosed in advance. That means there has been no great clamor for treatments. Maybe only 200 people in the U.S. know they have a time bomb like Vallabh, she says, and there\\u2019s not a single drug currently in human testing. Early on, Ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect.\\n\\nBut by blotting out the prion protein at its source, an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it. Fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon, as are cases of mad cow disease, but adding these \\u201cultra-rare\\u201d diseases together makes them, as a group, slightly less rare.\\n\\nVallabh and Minikel say they now have proof that Ionis\\u2019s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease. Those animals given the drug live about 70 percent longer.\\n\\nKordasiewicz now terms the program a \\u201ccommercial\\u201d project at Ionis, though it remains too small and early-stage to appear on the company\\u2019s pipeline chart of drugs under development. \\u201cWhat changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nVallabh hopes it can all go even faster. The fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow, or in 30 years. There\\u2019s no way to predict it. She and Minikel just had their first child. The girl was conceived through IVF, and Vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn\\u2019t carry the mutation.\\n\\nTo save herself, it\\u2019s not going to be enough to have a drug. She needs to get it before she ever falls ill. Yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention.\\n\\nFiguring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for Vallabh and her husband. It appears they hope the US Food and Drug Administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations. Since it can take decades for people to get sick (or not), such a study would instead rely on a biomarker, such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid.\\n\\nVallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug. \\u201cThe big picture,\\u201d she says, \\u201cis we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were handed.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 848,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/02/24/crossroads-church-nonprofit-wipe-out-46-5-million-medical-debt/4854753002/?fbclid=IwAR1MMDWZKi9U_rQ8bwSZB_irls6Ejjqgu4oMrZuozZ23yI8qG5tIEKw59-s\",\n          \"https://theweek.com/speedreads/879727/austria-turning-site-hitlers-birth-into-police-station-repel-neonazis\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
